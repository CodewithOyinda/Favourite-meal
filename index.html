    <p><b>Tips</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do not completely cook rice in one go as they will be cooked properly in steps further.</li>
        <li>Adding the sauces after adding vegetables can spoil their colour and texture. Refrain from doing so.</li>
        <li>Toss the pan as much as possible while cooking instead of using a ladle. This will prevent the rice from breaking.</li>
    </ul>
